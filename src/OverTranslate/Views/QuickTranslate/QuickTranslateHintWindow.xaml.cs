/// <summary>
/// The one thing 快速翻譯 puts on the screen: a line saying what is happening to the text the user
/// just selected.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The feature itself is invisible — a shortcut goes in, somebody else's document changes — and
/// without this the user would press a key and watch nothing happen for as long as a translation
/// takes. So the card exists to answer three questions in the order they occur to them: is it
/// working, did it work, and if not, why not.
///
/// It appears without an entrance. Something is already in flight by the time it is shown and the
/// user is waiting on it, so a card that grows or slides in spends that time on the announcement
/// rather than on the answer. It leaves with a fade, which is the opposite case: nothing is waiting
/// on it, and a card that vanished between two frames would leave the reader unsure what they saw.
///
/// It sits by the pointer, which is where the hand and the eye already are at the end of the gesture
/// that made the selection — and the one anchor that is always available. See
/// <see cref="HintPlacement"/>.
///
/// One at a time. A second shortcut press replaces the card outright rather than stacking another on
/// top of it — see <see cref="Summon"/> — because the newer one is the only one whose outcome the user
/// is still waiting for.
///
/// It never takes activation. The paste that replaces the selection is sent to whatever window has
/// the foreground, so a hint that took the foreground would be pasting the translation into itself.
