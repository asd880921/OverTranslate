/// 快速翻譯: the selected text, translated and put back in its place.

/// <remarks>
/// The shortest path this application has. The other three translation surfaces all end with the
/// user reading an answer in a window of ours and deciding what to do with it; this one ends with
/// their own document changed and nothing of ours left on screen. It is for the case where the
/// answer is not something to read but something to write — a message being typed in another
/// language, a line in a document that has to end up translated.
///
/// Built out of the pieces 取詞翻譯 already proved: the selection is read by borrowing the copy
/// shortcut, and it is replaced by borrowing the paste one. See <see cref="SelectedTextReader"/> and
/// <see cref="SelectionReplacer"/> for why that is the only mechanism available.
///
/// Nothing at all happens when there is no selection, and deliberately nothing is said about it: the
/// user pressed a shortcut that acts on selected text without selecting any, and an error card over
/// their screen would make a non-event into an interruption. The log carries it instead, because the
/// other reason for an empty read is that the application refused the copy — which is a bug report
/// waiting to be made.
