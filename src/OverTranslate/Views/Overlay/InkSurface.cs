/// <para>The reason is what it costs to have them on screen at all, which is separate from what it
/// costs to draw or rub one out. A finished stroke left as a <c>Polyline</c> is re-rasterised every
/// time anything overlapping it changes, and it cannot be skipped the way a small shape can, because
/// a scribble's box covers most of the screen. Measured with a ring moved over the ink the way the
/// eraser cursor is: an empty surface renders a frame in 6.1ms, ten scribbles in 11.6ms, and thirty
/// in 19.6ms with frames as long as 30ms — visible as a cursor that will not keep up, before any
/// erasing has been asked for. The same thirty baked into one bitmap render in 6.1ms, which is the
/// empty figure again. The cost of showing what has been drawn stops depending on how much it is.</para>
///
/// <para>Ink goes on and the eraser takes off, both straight into the pixels: source-over for one
/// and destination-out for the other, each costing the area it touches and nothing else. Both are a
/// line of arithmetic here because the bitmap is premultiplied — the colour channels already carry
/// their alpha, so fading a pixel out is multiplying all four of them by the same number, and
/// laying one over another is an add and a multiply. Getting that wrong is what leaves coloured
/// fringes along an erased edge, and it is only right if the format is not mixed up.</para>
///
/// <para>What is not here is undo. The picture cannot be stepped backwards — pixels do not remember
/// what they covered — so the marks are still kept as a list of strokes, and going back a step
/// repaints this from that list. See <c>Replay</c>.</para>
