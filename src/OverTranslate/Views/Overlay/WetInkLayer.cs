/// <remarks>
/// <para>Separate from the finished marks because a line being drawn is the one thing on the surface
/// that changes on every pointer event. Left as a growing <c>Polyline</c> it is described again in
/// full every time a point is added: measured over one stroke that is 0.29ms at the thousandth point
/// and 0.76ms at the four thousandth, 2177ms of rebuilding across a single long scribble — the
/// drawing going gradually stiff that a user reports as "it gets worse the longer I draw, and the
/// next stroke is fine again".</para>
///
/// <para>Blocks rather than one visual per segment. A segment on its own has to be given end caps,
/// and end caps are not what happens at a bend: a 螢光筆 is flat-ended, because that is what a
/// chisel tip looks like, so a line made of separately capped pieces leaves a wedge of bare screen
/// at the outside of every turn and comes out looking dashed while it is being drawn. Inside a block
/// the bends are the line's own joins, drawn round, and the block is rasterised in one go — so the
/// ink is the same ink the finished stroke is made of. Each block starts on the segment the last one
/// ended with, which puts every join inside some block and leaves only the two true ends of the
/// stroke wearing a cap.</para>
///
/// <para>What that costs is one block redrawn per pointer event, which is a fixed sixty-odd points
/// however long the stroke goes on.</para>
///
/// <para>The blocks are drawn opaque and the whole layer is faded instead, which is what keeps a
/// 螢光筆 even. Drawing them at the stroke's own opacity would compose them one over another and
/// leave a darker knot everywhere the line crosses itself or merely turns — the same reason the
/// finished stroke carries its opacity on the element rather than in its brush.</para>
