/// Corrects the glyph height reported for a line of one to three characters, which is the number
/// both overlays size their font from.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The height a Latin block reports starts at 0.82 of its detection box — far too generous, because
/// the box is roughly half again as tall as the glyphs in it — and is pulled back to the truth by a
/// clamp against the average glyph pitch. That clamp needs several letters to average over, so it
/// is only applied from four glyphs up, and below that the 0.82 stands unchallenged.
///
/// Measured by drawing known text and reading back what the recogniser returned, at a 64px and a
/// 40px em:
///
/// <code>
///   text                 glyphs   box/em (64px, 40px)   reported   true
///   YA                        2   1.48   1.45               78      46
///   Wow                       3   1.38   1.60               72      46

/// </code>
///
/// The long line, corrected by pitch, lands within a pixel. The two-letter line is 1.7x too large,
/// which is what turned a subtitle reading "YA" into an enormous 耶 across the picture.
///
/// Pitch cannot simply be extended downwards: on two letters it is whatever those two letters
/// happen to be — "YA" measured 1.05 of an em where a full line measures 0.55 — and the clamp it
/// yields (88) is looser than the estimate it was meant to tighten (78). The box is used instead,
/// because the ratio of true glyph height to box height held between 0.48 and 0.54 across every
/// sample, at every length.
///
/// Latin only, matching where the reported height comes from. A CJK source is normalised a
/// different way and has not been measured; nothing here touches it.
