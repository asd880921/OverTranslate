/// Nothing at eight cores or below moves. That matters more than the gain does: the measurements
/// behind this were taken on a sixteen-core machine, where four threads is a quarter of it, and they
/// do not transfer to a four-core machine where four threads is all of it — and this application's
/// premise is a game running behind it. A small machine keeps the shipped numbers and lets its
/// blocks queue, which is a graceful thing to do: a refused poll is skipped and retried 250ms later,
/// so the block updates less often rather than failing.
///
/// Four threads is the ceiling because the model stops scaling there rather than because of the
/// machine: measured on sixteen cores, six threads (370ms) was slower than four (356ms). Above
/// sixteen cores the peak is allowed to grow to 16, which is still a quarter of a 64-core machine.
///
/// A pure function of the core count so the table above can be a test rather than a comment. The
/// rule it replaces was <c>Clamp(ProcessorCount, 1, 2)</c>, which reads as though it scales with the
/// machine and does not — everything from two cores to sixty-four came out at two.
