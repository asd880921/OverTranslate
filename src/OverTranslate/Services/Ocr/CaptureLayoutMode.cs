/// capture the user framed, and it is the user who knows whether the box is a page of prose or a
/// game menu. It decides two things and nothing else: how far the grouping thresholds are relaxed,
/// and whether the translation is laid back onto each source line or set as one block.</para>
///
/// <para>Deliberately not carried on <see cref="OcrTextBlock"/>. A block is not general or an
/// interface — the capture is. Putting it there is how one field ends up meaning four things, which
/// is what the layout-metric split was spent undoing.</para>
///
/// <para>Persisted by name, so that a third mode can be added without changing what the settings
/// file looks like — see <see cref="Models.CaptureSettings.LayoutMode"/>. A name this build does not
/// know fails to deserialize, which is what makes the reader keep the property's default, and the
/// default is <see cref="General"/>.</para>
