///
/// <para>All three fields sit on the set-solid path — the strictest geometry in the file, a pair
/// already through the leading and shared-edge tests. Two of them relax what counts as evidence for
/// such a pair. The third relaxes the leading itself, which is a boundary this type did not cross
/// before, and it is written down as one: a mode may move the limit that decides whether a pair is
/// set solid, and may still not move the shared-edge test that decides whether it is aligned.</para>
///
/// <para>THREE FIELDS, ON PURPOSE. Every one added has to arrive with a measured case from the
/// image corpus behind it — one was designed and then dropped again when the rule it would have
/// relaxed turned out never to fire on any image measured, and the third arrived only after the
/// version without it was built, measured, and found to relax the interface mode as well. A profile
/// with a dozen knobs is the mode quietly becoming a second source language, which is the thing
/// this whole seam exists to prevent. Nothing in the type stops a fourth being added; this is a
/// review contract, and a locked constructor would only produce a test-only factory to get around
/// it.</para>

///
/// <para>MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. Six long-form web pages were annotated by hand before any threshold
/// moved, and their pairs sort into two populations with a gap between: a paragraph's seams run up
/// to <c>1.45</c>, and the list entries that must stay apart start at <c>1.68</c> — 1.68, 1.72,
/// 1.76 and 1.79 for the four held by geometry alone. The relaxed figure sits on the lower edge of
/// that gap. Before it, the general mode joined 24 of 55 paragraph seams and refused 31, every one
/// of the refusals wrong; after it, the six pages go from 140 groups to 113.</para>
///
/// <para><b>THE MARGIN IS NOT 0.23 EVERYWHERE.</b> That gap was measured on bulleted lists in
/// running text. A game settings panel's checkbox entries are a different population and sit at
/// <c>1.47</c> and above — <b>0.02 line heights</b> above the relaxed figure, which is the narrowest
/// margin anywhere in this rule. The interface mode is the answer to that (it keeps 1.20, so its
/// margin is 0.27), but the general mode is the default, so a user who frames a settings panel
/// without switching modes is standing on the 0.02. Recorded as a known cost rather than closed.

/// <para><b>It does nothing for a news portal's headline list, and no larger figure would.</b>
/// Those are set <i>tighter</i> than running prose — 1.22 and 1.23 against a paragraph's 1.30 to
/// 1.40 (see <c>OcrTextBlockGrouper.StartsWithListBullet</c>) — so on this axis the two populations
/// are ordered the wrong way round, and every leading limit reaches the headlines before it reaches
/// the paragraphs. Raising this number buys strung-together headlines, not paragraphs. It is why
