/// Synthesised keystrokes, sent to whatever application has the foreground.

/// <remarks>
/// Two features borrow the foreground application's own editing shortcuts rather than asking it
/// anything: <see cref="SelectedTextReader"/> sends Ctrl+C to find out what is selected, and
/// <see cref="SelectionReplacer"/> sends Ctrl+V to put a translation in its place. Windows offers no
/// way to do either of those things directly to another process, so the chord is the mechanism, and
/// this is the one copy of it.
///
/// Everything here is about a chord surviving the trip. The modifiers the user is still holding —
/// the ones that fired the shortcut — are released first, so what arrives is a plain Ctrl+key rather
/// than the Ctrl+Alt+key the reader actually has under their fingers. The chord is then held down
/// briefly instead of being pressed and released in one batch: ordinary controls consume every key
/// event, but a game may sample keyboard state once per frame and miss a chord whose complete
/// lifetime falls between two samples.
