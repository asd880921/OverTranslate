/// What Windows.Graphics.Capture can actually do on the machine this is running on, asked of the

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The build number is not the answer to any of these questions. Capture is refused outright on
/// systems whose graphics stack cannot serve it regardless of version; the window exclusion list is
/// new enough that being on a build that shipped it is no promise that this projection can reach it;
/// and turning off the capture border needs a consent this application's deployment model may not be
/// able to ask for. Each is asked separately, and the answers go in the log — the first thing any
/// report about this feature needs is which capture path the user was actually on.
///
/// Nothing here throws. An unavailable API is a fact about the system, not a failure.
///
/// Every answer is cached after the first ask. None of them can change while the process runs — a
/// Windows that gains the exclusion list gained it in an update that needed a restart — and they are
/// now read from the interface, where 擷取來源 decides which modes to offer before the user has
/// chosen anything. Asked once at launch by <see cref="DisplayDiagnostics"/>, which puts them in the
/// log next to the build number that decides them, and warm for everything after.
