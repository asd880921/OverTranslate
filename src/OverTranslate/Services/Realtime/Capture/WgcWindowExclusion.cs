/// <summary>
/// The window exclusion list: telling a capture session to leave named windows out of its frames,
/// which is what lets a monitor capture serve a source that OverTranslate is drawing its own
/// overlays on top of.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Hand-written for the same reason as <see cref="WgcInterop"/>, and one more. The API lives on
/// <c>IDisplayGraphicsCaptureSession</c>, an interface the metadata does not declare
/// <see cref="GraphicsCaptureSession"/> as implementing — a session gets it only when its item is a
/// display, and only by asking for it at runtime. And the C# projection this project compiles
/// against (Windows SDK 10.0.26100) does not have the interface at all: the first projection that
/// does ships for net9.0 upwards, so reaching it from net8.0 means going to the ABI by hand. The
/// system underneath has it regardless — <see cref="WgcCapability.SupportsWindowExclusion"/> asks
/// the machine, not the projection.
///
/// Two things travel back from the ABI that the whole design rests on. The set call returns a
/// <i>configuration iteration</i>, and every frame carries the iteration it was produced under
/// (<c>IDirect3D11CaptureFrame3</c>): a frame numbered below the one the exclusion was accepted at
/// was composed before it took effect and may still hold the overlays. That is the difference
/// between this and <c>WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE</c> — the request is not the promise, the frame is —
/// and it is exactly what #94 got wrong.
