/// <summary>
/// Copies a captured frame's surface down to a <see cref="System.Drawing.Bitmap"/>, synchronously,
/// through Direct3D 11 itself.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This used to be one line — <c>SoftwareBitmap.CreateCopyFromSurfaceAsync(...).GetAwaiter()
/// .GetResult()</c> — and that line is what #116 turned out to be. It is an asynchronous WinRT
/// operation, and it was being waited on from inside <c>FrameArrived</c>, which the capture stack
/// raises on a thread of its own choosing. On Windows 11 that thread's apartment lets the completion
/// arrive elsewhere and the wait ends. On Windows 10 it does not: the completion is queued back to
/// the very thread that is blocked waiting for it, and the readback never returns.
///
/// From the outside that deadlock is indistinguishable from a capture that produces nothing. The
/// frame handler is serialised, so the first frame going in and never coming out means no second
/// frame is delivered either, and the counters read <c>received=1 read=0</c> — which is exactly what
/// the Windows 10 reports show, on the hardware adapter and on WARP alike, which is why neither
/// #117's adapter selection nor its software retry moved them.
///
/// So the async call is gone and the copy is done by hand: a staging texture, a
/// <c>CopySubresourceRegion</c>, a <c>Map</c>. Every step is synchronous, none of it touches the
/// WinRT threading model, and it cannot be deadlocked by the thread it is called on. It is also the
/// cheaper path — one GPU-to-CPU copy of just the content region into a staging texture that is
/// reused between frames, rather than a fresh <c>SoftwareBitmap</c> allocated per frame.
///
/// The interop is by vtable slot rather than by declaring these interfaces method for method.
/// D3D11's are large, and three of the four calls needed here sit late in them; a slot index that is
/// wrong is caught by the first call that uses it, while a mis-declared method thirty slots earlier
/// is not caught at all.
/// </remarks>
