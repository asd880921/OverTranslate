/// Three failures rather than one, because they are three different things to tell the user. A
/// window that hands over only flat frames is presenting past the compositor — a game in exclusive
/// fullscreen — and the answer is a setting inside that game. A window that hands over nothing at
/// all has a capture chain that never ran, which the user cannot act on and a log can. Anything
/// else was refused outright, before any frame was waited for.
///
/// The distinction is new because the old message covered all of them with the fullscreen
/// explanation, which sent a user whose game was already windowed looking for a setting that was
/// not the problem.
