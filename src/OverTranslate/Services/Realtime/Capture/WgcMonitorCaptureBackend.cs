/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// This is the full-screen source done the way the window source already works: the isolation is a
/// property of what is being captured, not a favour asked of the windows drawing on top of it. The
/// session is told which windows to leave out, the system composes the monitor without them, and the
/// excluded rectangles come back showing what is <i>underneath</i> — measured, because everything
/// here depended on that and nothing said it: with a stand-in subtitle layer over a source window,
/// the layer went from 98.5% of the region to 0.0%, and 98.1% of it came back as the source window
/// rather than as black (<c>WgcProbe exclusion</c>).
///
/// What it replaces on that path is <c>WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE</c>, which asks each overlay to hide
/// itself from anything reading the screen and fails silently on every Windows before 11 24H2 —
/// #94, where the loop spent nine seconds translating its own output. The difference is not that
/// this API is newer. It is that the request and the promise are separate here: the set call returns
/// the configuration iteration from which the exclusion holds, every frame says which iteration it
/// was composed under, and this backend simply does not read a frame from before that number. There
/// is no state in which it believes an exclusion that did not happen.
///
/// The cost is who can use it. The exclusion list needs a Windows much newer than 24H2, so a system
/// without it has no 螢幕擷取 at all — this is the only backend for that mode, and
/// <c>RealtimeSessionController.CreateScreenCapture</c> refuses rather than offering a second one.
/// There used to be a second one, grabbing the composited desktop with the overlays asked to hide
/// themselves; it was dropped in #105 precisely because that arrangement cannot be checked from
/// inside the program, which is the difference this backend exists to make.
