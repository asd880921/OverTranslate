/// This exists to hold one rule in one place: <b>recognition must never run on a frame that may
/// contain OverTranslate's own overlays.</b> Which is a question about the capture source, not about
/// the overlays — and for most of this feature's life it was answered in the wrong place, by asking
/// the subtitle windows to hide themselves from the screen via <c>WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE</c>. That
/// works only where the source is the composited desktop, and it fails outright on every Windows
/// before 11 24H2 (#94), where it cost users a loop that translated its own output.
///
/// So a backend is answerable for its own isolation. <see cref="IsIsolated"/> is the promise, made
/// before a single region is read; a backend that cannot make it is not used. What that costs varies
/// by source — a backend that captures the watched window directly never had the overlays in frame
/// to begin with, a monitor capture has the session compose the screen without them, and the desktop
/// grab has to ask the overlays to hide themselves — and none of that reaches the session, which
/// asks for a rectangle and gets pixels.
