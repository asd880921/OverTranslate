/// <remarks>
/// This exists to hold one rule in one place: <b>recognition must never run on a frame that may
/// contain OverTranslate's own overlays.</b> Which is a question about the capture source, not about
/// the overlays — and for most of this feature's life it was answered in the wrong place, by asking
/// the subtitle windows to hide themselves from the screen via <c>WDA_EXCLUDEFROMCAPTURE</c>. That
/// works only where the source is the composited desktop, and it fails outright on every Windows
/// before 11 24H2 (#94), where it cost users a loop that translated its own output.
///
/// So a backend is answerable for its own isolation, and answerable structurally — by what it
/// captures, not by what it asks other windows to do about themselves. A window capture never had
/// the overlays in frame to begin with; a monitor capture has the system compose the screen without
/// them and refuses to read a frame composed before that took effect. There is no third kind: the
/// backend that grabbed the composited desktop and relied on the overlays hiding themselves was
/// removed in #105, because its isolation was a claim the program could not check.
///
/// <see cref="IsIsolated"/> is that promise stated, made before a single region is read; a backend
/// that cannot make it is not used. None of how it is kept reaches the session, which asks for a
/// rectangle and gets pixels.
