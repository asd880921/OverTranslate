/// 視窗擷取 asks the user to draw blocks over a window, and gives them a full-screen layer to draw on.
/// Nothing about that arrangement guarantees the window is visible: they chose it from a list, which
/// they could reach with the window buried behind the shell, a browser and a file manager. Framing
/// then means dismissing this application's own layer to go and find the thing they just named,
/// which is the sort of step a program should take rather than ask for.

/// Only in 視窗擷取. 螢幕擷取 reads the screen as it is arranged, so rearranging it is precisely the
/// wrong thing to do — whatever the user left on top is what they meant to translate.

    /// Windows refuses foreground changes from a process that does not currently own the foreground,
    /// to stop applications stealing focus — and by the time this runs, the shell window that was
    /// foreground when the user pressed the button may already be hidden, so this process no longer
    /// qualifies. Attaching to the target's input queue for the duration is the long-standing way
    /// through: while attached, the two threads share a foreground state, and the call is allowed.
    ///
    /// Restoring a minimised window first, because a minimised window cannot be raised and the
    /// picker's own list excludes them — but the user can minimise one between choosing it and
    /// pressing 選取翻譯區塊, and that is not a reason to leave them looking at a desktop.
    ///
    /// Best effort throughout. Every step here can legitimately fail — the window can close between
    /// two calls, and a full-screen exclusive game can decline to be reordered — and none of that is
    /// worth stopping a session for: the user still has the framing layer and can put the window in
    /// front themselves, which is what they had to do before this existed.
