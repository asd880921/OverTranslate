/// Decides, poll by poll, whether one watched region is worth recognising again. Holding this apart
/// from the loop keeps the policy — the part with all the ways to be subtly wrong — testable without
/// a screen, a model or a network.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The policy hangs on one observation: <b>a region is mostly not text.</b> Over a video or a game,
/// comparing the whole rectangle reports a change on every single poll, because the picture behind
/// the subtitle never stops moving. There is then nothing to wait for — no two frames are ever alike
/// — so a rule that waits for the picture to settle waits forever, and one that gives up waiting
/// after a fixed delay pays that delay on every line of dialogue.
///
/// So once a pass has found text, this stops watching the region and watches only the strips the
/// text was found in, padded enough to catch a new line appearing beside it. Background motion
/// outside those strips is then invisible, a subtitle changing shows up on the very next poll, and
/// the region falls quiet in between instead of being recognised on a timer.
///
/// The comparison itself is <see cref="FrameFingerprint"/> rather than an exact hash, because the
/// pixels inside those strips are not stable either — that difference alone took one measured region
/// from recognising continuously to recognising when its words changed. Text appearing somewhere
/// else entirely is what <see cref="FullRescanPolls"/> is for: nothing short of recognition can tell
/// it from background motion, so it is checked occasionally rather than never.
