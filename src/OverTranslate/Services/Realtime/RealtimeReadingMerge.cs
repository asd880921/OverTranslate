/// The rule itself — a re-reading of a sentence has to be better read than the one already shown
/// before it may take its place — is not new, and the reason for it has not changed: without it the
/// overlay shows the newest reading rather than the best one, and a line is rewritten several times
/// while saying the same thing, which reads far worse than one wrong character.
///
/// What is new is the granularity. Applied to a whole pass, the rule compared one weighted average
/// against another, so a sentence that had just been read correctly could be thrown away because a
/// second sentence in the same frame happened to score a little lower than last time. Measured on a
/// live subtitle track: <c>"a facility to study that weird guitar..."</c> was read correctly at 0.99
/// and rejected, leaving <c>guitr</c> on screen, because the line above it had wobbled. The
/// correction had no way to land on its own — it had to wait for the whole batch to beat the whole
/// batch, which for that sentence never happened.
///
/// So each line is compared against the line it is a re-reading of, and nothing else. A sentence is
/// only ever rewritten when its <em>own</em> reading improves, which is strictly stronger than the
/// pass-level rule was: that one also let a sentence be overwritten by a worse reading of itself
/// whenever its neighbour improved enough to carry the average.
///
/// The one reading that is taken without improving is the one that is not a re-reading at all: a
/// line that contains the shown one and carries on past it is the same sentence finishing its
/// animation, and no score it could arrive with would say so. See
/// <see cref="TextSimilarity.IsContinuationOf"/>.
///
/// Lines are paired across passes by what they say, not where they are. Position sorts the
/// candidates — the same sentence rarely jumps up the frame between two polls 250ms apart — but the
/// text decides, because a line appearing above the current one shifts every box below it while the
/// words stay put. A read line that pairs with nothing is new, and a shown line nothing pairs with
/// has gone; both are real changes and neither is held back.
