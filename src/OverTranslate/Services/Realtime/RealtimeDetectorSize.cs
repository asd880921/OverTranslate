/// <summary>
/// What size to hand the text detector when reading a watched region.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The detector has a size of text it is good at, and subtitles are well outside it. Measured on two
/// captured frames of a 1226x196 subtitle strip, sweeping the detector's input size in steps of 64:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>at 0.37–0.78 of native, both frames read correctly every time;</item>
/// <item>at 0.84 and above, both collapsed — the detector returned one box spanning the whole strip
/// (measured at 201 and 256 pixels tall against a real line height of 88–117), and recognising that
/// stretched crop produced either nothing at all or "Mainasm ar you lay" for "Marina-san, are you
/// okay?".</item>
/// </list>
///
/// The glyphs in those frames are around 60px tall; halving puts them near 30px, which is where that
/// model was trained. That was why a subtitle strip was read at half scale — but only a strip: an
/// interface panel holds much smaller text and needs the opposite correction. That last part still
/// holds, and which of the two a block is comes from <see cref="RealtimeBlockMode"/>, i.e. from the
/// user; see <see cref="StripFraction"/> and <see cref="PanelFraction"/>. The halving itself is
/// gone — see the closing paragraph.
///
/// None of this reaches the screenshot flow, which asks for no downscale at all and is right to:
/// its text is interface-sized, already inside the detector's range, and downscaling it would
/// destroy the detail that <c>ImgResize = 2048</c> exists to keep.
///
/// EVERYTHING ABOVE WAS MEASURED ON PP-OCRv5_mobile_det, WHICH IS NO LONGER THE DETECTOR. The
/// collapse it describes was real, and the reason for it — a size the model dislikes returns one
/// box across the whole strip — was the diagnosis issue #22 spent three rounds confirming. What
/// changed is the model: swept over 15 frames a live session had failed to read, PP-OCRv5 read 8
/// at 0.40, 4 at 0.50, 6 at 0.55 and 8 at 0.60, while PP-OCRv6_det_tiny reads 9 across that whole
/// band and 9 at native. There is no dead band left to steer around.
///
/// The fractions did not change when the model did, and for a while the reason given for keeping
/// them was cost: a strip read at 0.50 and at native read the same 9 of those 15 frames, for 89ms
/// against 186ms, so halving looked like the same answer for half the work. That reasoning was
/// unsound, and this type's own remarks said why at the time — every one of those 15 frames was one
/// the primary size had FAILED to read, and a fraction cannot be judged on those, because it is
/// never asked about the frames it reads WRONGLY rather than not at all. The note ended: "a sweep on
/// the control group (frames the primary size already read) is what would move them."
///
/// That sweep is issue #81, and it moved them. On 109 frames the primary size did read, 0.50 got 78%
/// of them right and 0.85 got 94%, so a fifth of what halving read, it read wrong — silently, since
/// the fallback chain only runs when a read finds NOTHING and a wrong answer is still an answer.
/// <see cref="StripFraction"/> carries the full table and what the losses looked like.
///
/// Two things there are worth keeping in mind before touching these numbers again. Native is not the
/// answer either — 1.00 reads worse than 0.85, so both directions away from the detector's preferred
/// scale cost accuracy, which is why these are fractions at all rather than "no downscale, like the
/// screenshot flow". And the whole corpus is regions about 1820 wide, so fraction and absolute size
/// cannot be told apart in it.
///
/// Issue #89 broke that tie by cropping whole screens at five margins and sweeping every scale on
/// each — the same glyphs at the same fraction, over a range of absolute sizes. Of the candidates,
/// the one that predicts whether the text reads is the glyph's height in DETECTOR space
/// (region glyph height x fraction). Absolute detector size does not (non-monotone, 15 points from
/// end to end) and neither does how much of the region the text occupies (non-monotone, no signal).
///
/// What that variable predicts is a FLOOR, not an optimum: below about 15px reading collapses, and
/// above about 20–25px it stops mattering. That much holds across both corpora and every success
/// criterion tried. It is worth being precise here because two tidier stories did not survive —
/// "the model wants ~30px" is PP-OCRv5 folklore, and "bigger keeps helping, saturating at 40–50px"
/// is what the strictest criterion alone shows on one corpus; loosen it and the same data turns
/// down past 40. See OcrHarness --margin-scale-grid.
