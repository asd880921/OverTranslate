/// <remarks>
/// The detector has a size of text it is good at, and subtitles are well outside it. Measured on two
/// captured frames of a 1226x196 subtitle strip, sweeping the detector's input size in steps of 64:
///
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>at 0.37–0.78 of native, both frames read correctly every time;</item>
/// <item>at 0.84 and above, both collapsed — the detector returned one box spanning the whole strip
/// (measured at 201 and 256 pixels tall against a real line height of 88–117), and recognising that
/// stretched crop produced either nothing at all or "Mainasm ar you lay" for "Marina-san, are you
/// okay?".</item>
/// </list>
///
/// The glyphs in those frames are around 60px tall; halving puts them near 30px, which is where the
/// model was trained. So a region large enough to hold subtitle-sized text is read at half scale.
///
/// None of this reaches the screenshot flow, which asks for no downscale at all and is right to:
/// its text is interface-sized, already inside the detector's range, and downscaling it would
/// destroy the detail that <c>ImgResize = 2048</c> exists to keep.
