/// underneath and a sheer one leaves the reader with two overlapping sentences. That argument is
/// still right about subtitles burnt into a video, and wrong about everything else this feature is
/// pointed at: a dialogue box in a game is drawn on its own opaque panel, and there the band is
/// covering artwork rather than text. One value cannot serve both, and the person who can see the
/// screen is the one who knows which they are looking at.
