/// Catches Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y for 標記, for as long as 標記 is on.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>A process-wide low-level hook for the same reason <see cref="GlobalEscapeHook"/> is one:
/// nothing in this session holds the keyboard focus. The capture toolbar, the 標記 panel and the
/// overlay are all deliberately no-activate windows so that showing them cannot pull focus off the
/// application being captured — which means no ordinary key handler in this process will ever
/// fire.</para>
///
/// <para>Ctrl+Y and Ctrl+Shift+Z are both redo. Windows applications are split on which one they
/// use and users are split on which one they reach for; accepting both costs one comparison.</para>
///
/// <para>The keys are swallowed rather than passed on. While 標記 is on, the user is drawing on a
/// layer over someone else's window, and Ctrl+Z reaching that window would undo something there
/// instead — an edit in a document they cannot even see behind the capture. The hook lives exactly
/// as long as the panel does, so outside that mode the keys are the other application's again.</para>
