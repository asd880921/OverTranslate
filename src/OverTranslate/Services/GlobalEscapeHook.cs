// A process-wide low-level keyboard hook that swallows Esc and reports it to a callback.
//
// This belongs to the capture session rather than to any single window. Before a selection
// exists there is no overlay to host a hook, and ScreenCaptureWindow.OnKeyDown only fires while
// that window holds the keyboard focus — which it cannot count on (the tray menu closing right
// after it opens, full-screen games, elevated foreground windows). Owning the hook for the whole
// session is what makes Esc behave identically before and after the selection is drawn.
//
// The hook lives on its own message-pumping thread (see HookThread), and that is what makes Esc
// an escape hatch rather than one more thing that stops working. The capture layers are Topmost
// and cover the whole virtual desktop, so nothing — Task Manager included — can be raised over
// them; Esc is the way out. Installed from the dispatcher, the callback would be delivered to the
// dispatcher too, so any UI thread that stopped pumping would take Esc down with it at exactly the
// moment it was needed, and would stall the entire desktop's keyboard until LowLevelHooksTimeout
// on every key besides.
