/// buttons continue to reach the foreground application/game after OverTranslate reacts to them.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The hook and the controller poll live on a private message-pumping thread, and the hook callback
/// does nothing but hand the action over to the interface. Both follow from what a WH_MOUSE_LL
/// callback costs: Windows holds every mouse event in the system — including the ones the game the
/// user is playing is waiting for — until the callback returns, and a callback that outstays
/// <c>LowLevelHooksTimeout</c> is silently dropped from the hook chain, after which the shortcut is
/// dead for the rest of the session and nothing says why.
///
/// Running the action inside the callback is what made that reachable rather than theoretical: the
/// realtime shortcut builds a control bar and one overlay window per region before it returns.
/// Posting the action to the dispatcher answers that, but a hook installed FROM the dispatcher is
/// only serviced while the interface is idle — so a busy UI thread would go on delaying the whole
/// system's mouse for as long as it was busy, which is exactly the moment this feature exists for.
/// Its own thread is what decouples the two, and the controller poll comes off the dispatcher with
/// it.
