/// <para>Microsoft and Bing refuse more than a thousand characters, and GTranslate refuses the call
/// before it leaves the machine. Both Google endpoints accept far more — 3,000 was translated
/// complete and in order, every sentence accounted for. So this exists to keep the two engines that
/// have a limit usable, not because the other two need protecting from long text.</para>
///
/// <para>That matters more than it sounds. A block goes to whichever engine answers first, and when
/// a text is too long for Microsoft and Bing they both fail instantly, leaving Google as the only
/// engine that can serve it. That is how a 1,181-character paragraph came back with its last
/// sentence replaced by "僅在 GPU 10 秒上實現了 GPU 10 秒）" repeated seven times: not because it was
/// long, but because losing two engines to the limit forced it onto a third that mistranslates that
/// particular sentence. Split, it fits, Microsoft serves it, and it comes back right.</para>
///
/// <para>What this does NOT fix: Google loops on that sentence at any length — sent alone, 270
/// characters, it fails identically. Bisecting it clause by clause found what actually triggers it,
/// and it is not something this could act on:</para>
///
/// <code>
/// In terms of speed, PP-OCRv6_medium achieves 5.2× speedup over PP-OCRv5_server on Intel Xeon CPU
/// with OpenVINO (1.40s vs 7.30s), the tiny tier reaches 6.1× speedup on Apple M4 (0.96s vs 5.82s),
/// and only 0.13s on A100 GPU.
/// </code>
///
/// <para>Three parallel clauses in one sentence, 221 characters. Clauses one and two together are
/// fine, two and three together are fine, all three loop. Ending the sentence before the third
/// clause fixes it, as does removing the bracketed timings. The same shape with hotel prices
/// instead of benchmarks does not loop at all, so it is not structural either. Both Google
/// endpoints return the same broken answer byte for byte on repeated attempts, while Bing and
/// Microsoft translate it correctly.</para>
///
/// <para>So it is a property of somebody else's model, with no rule this side could apply in
/// advance. Catching it on the way back instead — measuring the answer for repetition and handing
/// the block to another engine — was built and measured and then deliberately not kept: the fault
/// is Google's, the check would run on every translation the application ever makes, and paying for
/// that everywhere to cover one endpoint's behaviour was not judged worth it. The record is here so
/// the next person to meet it knows what it is rather than diagnosing it again; the reproduction is
/// the sentence above, through <c>OcrHarness --xlate-line</c>.</para>
///
/// <para>The limit became reachable when a wrapped paragraph started going up as one request
/// instead of seven, which is the point of grouping and worth keeping. So it is answered where it
/// belongs — at the transport that has it — rather than by making the grouper translate less
/// context than the picture supports. Grouping decides what belongs together; this decides how much
/// of it an endpoint can be handed at once, and the two stay independent.</para>
