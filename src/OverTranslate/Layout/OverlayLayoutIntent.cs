/// a page, and it must not learn that by asking which capture mode the user picked: the mode is a
/// product word for what is in the picture, and the overlay is the wrong place to translate one
/// into the other. Placement reads the mode; the overlay reads this.</para>

/// <para>Nor can the shape of the data stand in for it. The obvious proxy —
/// <c>SourceLineBounds is { Count: &gt; 1 }</c> — already answers a different question by the time
/// it reaches here: the vertical pipeline refills that list with columns, or, for a lone column,
/// with one cell per character. Reading a layout policy out of it would be stacking a third meaning
/// on a field that already carries two.</para>
