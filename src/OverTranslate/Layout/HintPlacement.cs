/// The hint is the only thing telling the user that a shortcut they pressed over someone else's
/// window did anything at all, so it has to land where they are already looking. The pointer is that
/// place: selecting text is a gesture made with the mouse, and it is the one anchor that is always
/// available — the applications that will say where their selected characters are on screen are a
/// minority, and a hint that appeared in two different places depending on which application was in
/// front would be a rule nobody could learn.

/// Everything here is physical pixels on one monitor's work area, and every value it is given has
/// already been scaled for that monitor — see <see cref="Services.ScreenGeometry"/>. It computes and
/// does not measure, so the choice it makes can be tested.
