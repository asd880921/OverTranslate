/// <summary>
/// The mixed-language paths: a realtime session watching one language while a screenshot is
/// translated from another. Single-language use never reaches these, which is why they went
/// unexercised until concurrent inference was allowed.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Both tests FAIL against the engine as it stands, and are kept skipped as the record of that:
///   - TryRecognize... blocked 1071ms, though its whole contract is to give up rather than wait.
///   - Recognize... threw "等待其他辨識結束以切換 OCR 模型時逾時。" after 10s under three regions
///     of load, because a swap-waiter has no priority over new same-model callers and so starves.
/// They are skipped rather than fixed because the plan is to make the scenario unreachable:
/// screenshot translation is to be disabled while a realtime session runs. Unskip these only if
/// that exclusion is dropped — then the arbitration in AcquireRuntime has to be made fair, and
/// the EN↔KO model reload (~1s each way) has to be dealt with too.
/// </remarks>
