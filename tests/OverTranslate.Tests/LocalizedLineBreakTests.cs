// XAML collapses whitespace in element content, and a character reference is resolved by the XML
// reader before XAML ever looks at it — so a &#x0a; written into a string arrives as a line feed and
// leaves as a space. It shipped that way once: two sentences meant to sit on their own lines ran
// together in the settings card, and nothing failed to say so. xml:space="preserve" is what keeps
// the break, and it is easy to drop while editing the wording around it.
//
// Read as XML rather than through XamlReader, which would want an STA thread for what is really a
// question about the source file: a string that asks for a line break has to be marked to keep one.
//
// Only the strings the diagnostics card composes. Four older strings elsewhere have the same problem
// and are deliberately not covered — fixing them changes screens this had no business touching, and
// a test that fails for something nobody is fixing is a test people learn to ignore.

    // card's own hint still is, and is what this guards.
